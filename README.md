Hi! ðŸŒŠ
My name is Jayda Felix-Mounlath. 
I am Laotian, Samoan and Kiwi; bought up in Auckland. ðŸŒ´

Iâ€™m currently learning to be a Full Stack Developer at Mission Ready HQ.
So far I have learnt aspects in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, MySQL, MUI, Mongodb, Docker and React.js. 
Challenges help stimulate my brain and keep me engaged so I am always happy to learn new things!

I love design and believe that the small things matter.

Side Note * Illustrating and drawing are two of my passions - If you need any doodles, personal or business related feel free to contact me.
